This Retirement Calculator is a Single Page Web Application (SPA) built using React that helps users forecast their retirement savings and withdrawals over time. The application allows users to input various financial parameters, such as initial investment, pre-retirement rate of return, withdrawal rate, and other relevant factors.

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Easy to Deploy**: The app can be easily deployed to any static hosting provider like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or AWS S3.
